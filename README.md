Data analysis generally involves taking some source data and performing some series of operations upon it until you have reached your desired output. Sometimes, that data is bigger than any one computer can handle. This library provides a simple serialization system for data analysis, which can then be used to pass around the specific set of tasks to be accomplished and handled appropriately on the backend.
